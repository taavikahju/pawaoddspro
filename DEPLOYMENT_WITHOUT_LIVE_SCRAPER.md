# Deployment Without Live Scraper

To deploy your application on Replit without the live scraper feature:

## Deployment Steps

1. Replace your package.json with the deployment version:
   ```bash
   cp package.json.deploy package.json
   ```

2. Build the client:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## What This Removes

This deployment approach temporarily disables:

1. The live scraper feature (bp_gh_live_scraper.mjs)
2. Live heartbeat tracking
3. ES Module specific code that causes deployment issues

## How to Restore Original Functionality

After successfully deploying your application, you can restore your development environment:

```bash
cp package.json.bak package.json
```

## Technical Details

The main changes in this deployment:

1. Converted ES Module files to CommonJS (.cjs extension)
2. Removed top-level await and import.meta references
3. Created simplified implementations of key services
4. Used explicit __dirname instead of import.meta.dirname

These changes make your application compatible with Replit's deployment environment while preserving the core functionality.
