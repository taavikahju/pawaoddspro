# How to Update the Workflow

Since we can't directly edit the .replit file, please update the workflow manually:

1. Click on the "Start application" workflow in the sidebar
2. Click the "Configure" button (gear icon)
3. Change the command from `npm run dev` to `./run-simple.sh`
4. Click "Save"

This will update the workflow to use our simple server script, which we've confirmed works correctly.
