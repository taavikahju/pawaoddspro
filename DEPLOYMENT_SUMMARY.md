# Deployment Options Summary

This document outlines the different deployment options available for the pawaodds.pro application.

## Option 1: Direct Server Deployment (Recommended)

Best suited for a single production server setup, providing a good balance of simplicity and flexibility.

### Key Files:
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Comprehensive deployment guide
- `scripts/setup-server.sh` - Server preparation script
- `scripts/harden-server.sh` - Security hardening script
- `scripts/backup-db.sh` - Database backup script
- `scripts/deploy.sh` - GitHub-based deployment script
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow
- `ecosystem.config.js` - PM2 process management configuration
- `nginx.conf` - Nginx web server configuration

### Workflow:
1. Set up a GitHub repository for the code
2. Provision a Hetzner Cloud server
3. Run the server setup script
4. Configure GitHub Actions for continuous deployment
5. Securely access the admin interface

### Pros:
- Simple to set up and maintain
- Uses minimal resources
- Direct server access for troubleshooting
- Automated deployment through GitHub Actions

### Cons:
- Limited scalability
- Manual scaling if needed
- Some maintenance overhead

## Option 2: Docker Deployment

Suitable for containerized environments, enabling easier scaling and consistent environments.

### Key Files:
- `Dockerfile` - Application container definition
- `docker-compose.yml` - Multi-container setup
- `.dockerignore` - Container optimization

### Workflow:
1. Set up a Hetzner Cloud server
2. Install Docker and Docker Compose
3. Clone the repository
4. Configure environment variables
5. Run with `docker-compose up -d`

### Pros:
- Consistent environments
- Easier horizontal scaling
- Isolated services
- Simplified dependency management

### Cons:
- Additional complexity
- Higher resource usage
- Docker knowledge required

## Option 3: Simple File Transfer

For users without GitHub, a direct file transfer method is available.

### Workflow:
1. Set up a Hetzner Cloud server
2. Run server preparation script manually
3. Transfer code via SFTP or SCP
4. Initialize database and start application

### Pros:
- No GitHub dependency
- Direct control over deployment
- Simplest approach for non-developers

### Cons:
- Manual update process
- No version history
- Risk of inconsistent deployment

## Database Management

All deployment options include:
- PostgreSQL database setup
- Automatic schema updates via Drizzle ORM
- Daily database backups
- Script for restoring from backups if needed

## Security Considerations

All deployment methods incorporate:
- SSH hardening
- Firewall configuration
- Fail2ban for brute force protection
- HTTPS with Let's Encrypt
- Admin section protected by secure key

## Recommended Approach

For most users, Option 1 (Direct Server Deployment) provides the best balance of simplicity and functionality. The provided scripts automate most of the setup process, while GitHub Actions handle continuous deployment.

If you anticipate needing to scale horizontally in the future, consider Option 2 (Docker Deployment) for its containerization benefits.
