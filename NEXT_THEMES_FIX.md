# Next-Themes Deployment Fix

## Deployment Steps

1. Replace your package.json with the deployment version:
   ```bash
   cp package.json.deploy package.json
   ```

2. Click the Deploy button in Replit.

3. After deployment completes, restore your development package.json:
   ```bash
   cp package.json.bak package.json
   ```

## What This Script Fixes

The main issue in previous deployment attempt was an missing dependency on "next-themes". This script:

1. Creates a mock implementation of next-themes to satisfy the import
2. Explicitly marks next-themes as external in the Rollup config
3. Adds an alias in the resolve configuration to point to the mock implementation

This approach allows the build to complete without actually needing the next-themes dependency.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter further issues:

1. Check the build logs for any missing dependencies
2. Review the mock implementation to ensure it provides all needed functionality
3. Look for any other external dependencies that might need similar treatment
